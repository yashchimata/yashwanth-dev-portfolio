You‚Äôre my AI coding partner. I‚Äôm building an agentic AI framework that routes user input to the right agent using intent matching and confidence scoring.

Here‚Äôs the architecture I want to build (based on a real system someone shared with me):

‚∏ª

üîß System Overview:

Routing Flow:
	1.	User input is embedded using MiniLM
	2.	Embedding is compared to pre-stored intent vectors in ChromaDB
	3.	A confidence score is calculated for each potential agent
	4.	Routing decision:
	‚Ä¢	If confidence is high ‚Üí route to matching agent via registry
	‚Ä¢	If low or ambiguous ‚Üí forward to a Clarifier agent
	‚Ä¢	Clarifier reformulates input or summarizes recent context
	‚Ä¢	Retries routing once
	‚Ä¢	If still ambiguous ‚Üí fallback prompt to user

Agent Structure:
	‚Ä¢	Each agent extends a base Agent class
	‚Ä¢	Implements:
	‚Ä¢	accept_task() ‚Äî rule-based (tags + regex filters)
	‚Ä¢	execute() ‚Äî performs the task
	‚Ä¢	All agents self-register with a central Agent Registry

Caching & State:
	‚Ä¢	Cache results using input hash + agent ID
	‚Ä¢	Use SQLite for lightweight logging and simulating minimal state
	‚Ä¢	The system is stateless in memory but can recall prior interactions
